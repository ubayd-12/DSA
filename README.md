# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of coding problems categorized by the type of algorithm or data structure they emphasize. Each category is stored in its own folder, making it easy to navigate and find problems of interest.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the type of DSA topic they cover.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to a Topic:** Choose a DSA topic of interest and open the corresponding folder.
2. **Select a Problem:** Inside each folder, you'll find a collection of problems related to the topic.

## Contribution Guidelines

I welcome contributions to this repository! If you'd like to add a problem, improve existing solutions, or suggest enhancements, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Adding a New Problem:**
   - Ensure the problem is not already in the repository.
     - If it is you may add it, but emphasize it as a new version of an existing problem.
   - Add the problem under the relevent DSA topic folder if it exists
     - Else create a new folder under the relevant DSA topic.
   - Add a clear and concise problem statement, and the solution.
   - Feel free to program the problems in the problem of your choosing
2. **Improving Existing Solutions:**
   - Provide a clear explanation of your improvements or updates.
   - Update the README file if necessary to reflect your changes.
3. **General Guidelines:**
   - Please adhere to coding standards and include comments in your code for clarity.
   - Ensure your code is tested and correctly solves the problem.
